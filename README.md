# Computer_Vision
This repository includes the code of Computer Vision, such as Object Detection,   Semantic segmentation， Pedestrian re-identification, Clip, Vision Transformer, and so on.The code is implemented by Tensorflow2.0+ and Pytorch.If you like it, Please give me a star, thanks!


1. We have the [FCN（Fully Convolutional Network）](https://github.com/Geeksongs/Computer_Vision/tree/master/Semantic%20segmentation/FCN) example for Segmentations
